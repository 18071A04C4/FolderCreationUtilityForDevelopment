This application is a clone of the Structurer app featured in net.tutsplus.com.

The version 1.0.0.3 now supports nested folder structures and has some changes to it's UI based on Caio Dettmars design. The UI transformation is still not finished.

Also added a little exception handling, so it shouldn't exit abruptly.

4/5/2011 -- ADDED: Importing/Exporting of templates
4/5/2011 -- ADDED: Opening of the folder when finished
4/5/2011 -- MODIFIED: Changed source code formatting to comply with some standards

2/10/2011 -- FIXED: You can now download stuff from webscripts (ex. http://www.codeigniter.com/download.php) and the archive will be automatically extracted if it was a zip file.

New features waiting to be done: 
- maybe adding a new tag that automatically starts up your favorite editor.
- codebase refractoring
- notification area icon for quick access

NOTES:
- the template import does not verify the file or its contents
